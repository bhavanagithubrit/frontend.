            Paragraphs can be categorized by their content, such as narrative, descriptive, expository, and persuasive, or by their purpose, including introduction, body, transition, and conclusion paragraphs. There are also types based on logical structure like cause-and-effect, problem-solution, and comparison. The most common is the five-paragraph essay structure, which consists of an intro, three body paragraphs, and a conclusion.
