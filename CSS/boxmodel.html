      Paragraphs can be categorized by their content, such as narrative,</span> descriptive, expository, and persuasive, or by their purpose, including introduction, body, transition, and conclusion paragraphs. There are also types based on logical structure like cause-and-effect, problem-solution, and comparison. The most common is the five-paragraph essay structure, which consists of an intro, three body paragraphs, and a conclusion.
